Supermodel provides different "lenses" to view your codebase through. Each API endpoint generates a specific type of graph suited for different analysis tasks.

All graph generation is **asynchronous** — the API accepts your request, processes it in the background, and you poll for results. See [Async Polling](/async-polling) for details.

## Dependency Graph

**Endpoint:** `/v1/graphs/dependency`

The Dependency Graph maps relationships at the file and module level. It answers questions like "What files import `utils.ts`?" or "What is the dependency structure of this module?".

- **Nodes**: Files, Modules
- **Edges**: `imports`, `exports`

## Call Graph

**Endpoint:** `/v1/graphs/call`

The Call Graph provides a lower-level view, mapping function calls and class usage. It is essential for understanding execution flow, finding dead code, or tracing the impact of a function change.

- **Nodes**: Functions, Classes, Methods
- **Edges**: `calls`, `instantiates`, `overrides`

## Domain Graph

**Endpoint:** `/v1/graphs/domain`

The Domain Graph attempts to reverse-engineer the business domains and subdomains from the codebase. It clusters code artifacts into logical groups based on naming conventions, directory structure, and coupling.

- **Nodes**: Domains, Subdomains
- **Edges**: `dependsOn`, `contains`

## Parse Graph

**Endpoint:** `/v1/graphs/parse`

The Parse Graph exposes the raw Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) relationships. This is the most detailed view, useful for deep static analysis, linter rule creation, or refactoring tools.

- **Nodes**: AST nodes (declarations, identifiers, blocks)
- **Edges**: `parent`, `child`, `sibling`

## Supermodel Graph

**Endpoint:** `/v1/graphs/supermodel`

The Supermodel Graph is a unified representation that combines layers from all the above. It links the high-level domains down to the low-level AST nodes, providing a complete vertical slice of the system architecture.
